where the operator D is defined as D[...] = (1/r²) ∂/∂r [r²...].
The expressions we then obtain for the components ˆu_r, ˆu_θ, ˆu_φ of the flow field ˆu are given in Appendix C.
We now consider the derivation for the first-order solution (in Reynolds) u(1).
That flow field contains terms of different frequencies, but we are here only interested in the steady part of the flow.
For the sake of simplicity, we use u(1) to denote the steady component of this first-order flow.
The latter satisfies the following set of equations: ∇·σ(1) = (1/4)[(ˆu(0)·∇)ˆu(0) + (ˆu(0)·∇)ˆu(0)], and ∇·u(1) = 0.
Where complex conjugate quantities are underlined.
In the first-order governing equations, the term (v‖·∇)u(0) has been dropped since this term is time-dependent (dimensionless frequency 1) and we are only interested in steady flows.
Equations (57) and (58) have to be completed by the boundary conditions: u(1) = v(1) on S, and u(1) → 0 at infinity.
Where the unknown quantity v(1) is linked to v‖ by the relationship v‖ = Re v(1).
In order to obtain the first-order translation speed, we could try to derive the full velocity and stress fields u(1) and σ(1), and integrate the stress over the particle surface to obtain the propulsive force.
However, it is more convenient to use a suitable version of the reciprocal theorem, as suggested by Ho & Leal.
The standard version of the Lorentz reciprocal theorem can be found in Ref. [35].
For the same geometry, we consider now an auxiliary Stokes velocity and stress fields (ū, σ̄) satisfying ∇·σ̄ = 0 and ∇·ū = 0, with suitable boundary conditions to be specified below.
Subtracting the inner product of equation (57) with ū and the inner product of equation (62) with u(1), and integrating over the volume of fluid V leads to the equality of virtual powers as:
∫_V [ū·(∇·σ(1)) − u(1)·(∇·σ̄)] dV = (1/4) ∫_V ū·[(ˆu(0)·∇)ˆu(0) + (ˆu(0)·∇)ˆu(0)] dV.
Then, using the general vector identity: ū·(∇·σ(1)) − u(1)·(∇·σ̄) = ∇·(ū·σ(1) − u(1)·σ̄) + (∇u(1) : σ̄ − ∇ū : σ(1)).
