4.1 T4 mirror maps from coassociative fibrations
Let us begin by analyzing the generalized T4 mirror symmetry map in the context of TCS G2 manifolds.
As the Kovalev CYs X± admit mirrors by assumption, by the SYZ argument, these have two T3 special lagrangian fibrations.
Let us denote such fibrations by L±.
In the asymptotically cylindrical region of the manifold X± ∼ R+ × S1 × S±, the SYZ special lagrangians must asymptote to L± ∼ S1 × Λ±, where Λ± are the SYZ special lagrangian T2 fibrations within the asymptotic K3s (with respect to the K3 complex structure induced by the ambient CY).
In particular, they do not extend along the R+ direction.
Let us fix the phase of the holomorphic top form on X± such that the SYZ special lagrangians are calibrated as follows
volL± = −Im(Ω3,0±)|L±. (4.4)
Notice that a special lagrangian L gives rise to a coassociative cycle ML ≡ S1 × L ⊂ S1 × X if and only if it satisfies (4.4).
In particular,
Im(Ω3,0±) = dθ± ∧ IS± − dt± ∧ RS±. (4.5)
Therefore, for our special lagrangians L± we have
Im(Ω3,0±)|L± = −dθ± ∧ IS±. (4.6)
Now, Equation (3.3) entails that the four-cycles M± ≡ (S1)± × L± ⊂ J± are such that
?ϕ±|M± = dξ± ∧ dθ± ∧ (IS±)|Λ± = volM±. (4.7)
Which entails these are coassociative submanifolds.
Since
Ξ∗(?ϕ−|M−) = Ξ∗(dξ− ∧ dθ− ∧ IS−)  
= −dθ+ ∧ dξ+ ∧ −IS+  
= dξ+ ∧ dθ+ ∧ IS+  
= ?ϕ+|M+, (4.8)
the TCS glueing diffeomorphism Ξ is such that M± are glued into a coassociative submanifold M ⊂ J which has the topology of a T4, which may become singular along loci in J.
Performing three T-dualities along the L± SYZ fibres is mapping X± to their mirrors X∨± by construction.
However, as the S1 within the asymptotic CY cylinders are swapped with
