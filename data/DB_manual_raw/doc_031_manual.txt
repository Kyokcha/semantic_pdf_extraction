yS,m ∈ {2,4}, ∀νP(k) ≤ m < n.  
In fact, if yS,m ∈ {1,3} for some νP(k) ≤ m < n, then the PU packet is successfully decoded in slot m;  
similarly, if yS,m ∈ {5,6,7} for some νP(k) ≤ m < n, then the PU packet becomes connected to the root of the CD graph.  
Specializing (151) to this case and using (152), we need to prove the recursion MS,n+1 + vS,n+1 = MS,n + vS,n + χ(yS,n ∈ {1,2}).  
In fact, if yS,n ∈ {1,2}, the root is successfully decoded and the full CD potential is released, resulting in MS,n+1 = MS,n + vS,n.  
The new root of the CD graph becomes ρS(Gn+1) = n + 1 (new SU packet), with CD potential vS,n+1 = 1,  
so that MS,n+1 + vS,n+1 = MS,n + vS,n + 1.  
Otherwise, the root of the CD graph remains unchanged, ρS(Gn+1) = ρS(Gn),  
with CD potential vS,n+1 = vS,n, and no SU packets are decoded,  
so that MS,n+1 = MS,n.  
It follows that MS,n+1 + vS,n+1 = MS,n + vS,n.
