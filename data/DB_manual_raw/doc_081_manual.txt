Correlation functions which include the ghost fields are generated by adding to the action analogous source terms for the ghosts.  
1.1.2 Standard perturbative expansion (MLPE)  
Due to the presence of the non-linear interaction terms in S, the partition function (1.14) cannot be evaluated exactly and one has to resort to perturbative methods for its computation.  
As long as the coupling constant g is assumed to be small, one can aim to obtain a perturbative expansion of Z in powers of g.  
The g-dependence of the partition function comes from the exponential of the interaction terms Sint := SYM,int + SFP,int,  
Sint = ∫ ddx { − g fabc ∂µAaν Abµ Acν − (g²/4) fabc fade Abµ Acν Adµ Aeν + g fabc ∂µ ca Abµ cc }  
By Taylor-expanding the interaction exponential eiSint, the partition function can be rewritten as  
Z = ( ∫ DAaµ Dca Dca eiS0 ) ( ∑ (n=0 to ∞) (1/n!) ∫ DAaµ Dca Dca eiS0 (iSint)ⁿ / ∫ DAaµ Dca Dca eiS0 )  
Here S0 = S − Sint,  
S0 = ∫ ddx { − (1/2) ∂µ Aaν (∂µ Aaν − ∂ν Aaµ) − (1/2ξ) (∂µ Aaµ)² + ∂µ ca ∂µ ca }  
is the action for a free gauge vector field and a free ghost field.  
Eq. (1.22) can be expressed in momentum space as  
S0 = i ∫ (ddk / (2π)ᵈ) { (1/2) Aaµ(k) [ ∆0⊥ µν ab(k)⁻¹ + ∆0‖ µν ab(k)⁻¹ ] Abν(k)∗ + ca(k) G0 ab(k)⁻¹ cb(k) }
