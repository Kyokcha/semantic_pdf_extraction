FIG. 5. The ladder series of diagrams for the static susceptibility χc(s)_l. The exact χl is represented as a series M = 0,1,2,... of bubbles comprised of Green’s functions with poles on opposite halves of the complex frequency plane, i.e. whose contributions are computed close to the FS.
A pole can be avoided by closing the integration contour in the appropriate frequency half-plane, but the branch cut is unavoidable, and its presence renders the frequency integral finite.
Since there is no splitting, relevant fermionic ωk and k are not confined to the FS and are generally of order EF (or bandwidth).
Fermions at such high energies have a finite damping, i.e., are not fully coherent quasiparticles.
By this reason, the M = 0 contribution to χc(s)_l is labeled as an incoherent one, χc(s)_l,M=0 = χc(s)_l,inc (although at small U fermions with energies of order EF are still mostly coherent).
We next move to the M = 1 sector.
Here we select the subset of diagrams with one cross-section, in which we pick up the contribution from G(k,ωk)G(k + q,ωk) from the range where the poles in the two Green’s functions are in different half-planes of complex frequency.
The sum of such diagrams can be graphically represented by the skeleton diagram in Fig. 5 labeled M = 1.
The internal part of this diagram gives Z²(m*/m)χl,0(q), where χl,0(q) is given by (16).
The side vertices contain Λc(s)_1 λc(s)_l(kF), i.e. the product of the bare form-factor (which we already incorporated into χl,0(q)), and the contributions from all other cross-sections, in which G(k,ωk)G(k + q,ωk) is approximated by G²(k,ωk).
These contributions would vanish if we used a static U(|q|) for the interaction, but again become non-zero once we include dynamical screening at order U² and higher.
Similarly to the M = 0 sector, the difference Λc(s)_l − 1 is determined by fermions with energies of order EF.
Note, however, that in the M = 0 sector, all internal energies are of order EF.
In the M = 1 sector, internal energies for the vertices Λc(s)_l are of order EF, but external ωk are infinitesimally small, and external k are on the FS.
Overall, the contribution to the static susceptibility from the M = 1 sector is χc(s)_l,M=1 = (ZΛc(s)_l)² (m*/m) χc(s)_l,0.
Sectors with M = 2, M = 3 are the subsets of diagrams with 2,3,... cross-sections in which we split the poles of the Green’s functions with equal frequencies and momenta separated by q.
In the cross-sections in between the selected ones G(k,ωk)G(k + q,ωk) is again approximated by G²(k,ωk).
The contribution from the M = 2 sector is represented by the skeleton diagram in Fig. 5 labeled M = 2.
It contains fully dressed side vertices Λc(s)_l and a fully dressed anti-symmetrized static interaction between fermions on the FS.
One can easily verify that this interaction appears with the prefactor Z²(m*/m), i.e., the extra factor in the M = 2 sector compared to M = 1 is the product of χl,0 and the corresponding component of the Landau function.
Using (25) we then obtain χc(s)_l,M=1 + χc(s)_l,M=2 = (ZΛc(s)_l)² (m*/m) χc(s)_l,0 (1 − Fc(s)_l).
The minus sign comes from the number of fermion bubbles.
A simple bookkeeping analysis shows that contributions from sectors with larger M form a geometric series, which transform 1 − Fc(s)_l into 1/(1 + Fc(s)_l).
Collecting all contributions, we reproduce Eq. (4).
We now extend the analysis to the case when both transferred momentum q and transferred frequency Ω are vanishingly small, but the ratio Ω/v*F|q| is finite.
The computational steps are the same as for static susceptibility.
The contribution to χc(s)_l(q) from the M = 0 sector and the vertex function Λc(s)_l do not depend on the ratio of Ω/(v*F|q|) and remain the same as in the static case.
However, the integrand in the expression for χl,0(q), Eq. (16), now contains a non-trivial angular dependence via vF|q|cos φk / (Ω − vF|q|cos φk + iδΩ).
This makes the computation of series with M = 1,2,... more involved.
Consider first the limit Ω ≪ vF|q|.
For even l, the free-fermion susceptibility is χc(s)_l,0(q) = (m αl / π) (kF λc(s)_l(kF))² (1 + αl iΩ / vF|q|) = χc(s)_l,0 (1 + αl iΩ / vF|q|).
Where αl = 1 if l = 0 and αl = 2 if l = 2m, m > 0.
For odd l, the expansion in Ω starts with Ω².
The total contribution from the M = 1 sector still is proportional to χl,0.
