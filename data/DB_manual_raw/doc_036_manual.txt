We claim that q is adjacent to p in Ck.
Indeed, conditions C1 and C3 hold trivially.
To verify C2, consider a curve e ∈ S2 touching d at a point in the arc of d from q to q′.
This touching point (as the whole arc of d from q to q′) lies inside Ti.
However, e must intersect b, so it must leave Ti.
It touches a, so it must leave through either bi or c′i.
Here c′i has fewer than 2α²k points in X, by our choice of i, while bi contains fewer than α²k points in X, since Case 2 does not hold.
Hence, e has fewer than 3α²k points where it can leave Ti, and there are at most 3α²k possible choices for the curve e.
This means that condition C2 is satisfied and q is adjacent to p in Ck.
By our choice of i, we can select the curve d in at least k/α different ways, each giving rise to a different edge in Ck incident to p.
The total weight of these edges is α.
This completes the analysis of the last case, showing that the total weight of all edges in Ak, A′k, A′′k, Bk and Ck incident to p is at least α.
Summing over all l possible values of k and over all n² touching points in T, we conclude that the total weight of G is at least α d log n n².
Comparing this lower bound with the upper bound proved in the preceding subsection and substituting α = √log n / log log n, Theorem 7 follows.
