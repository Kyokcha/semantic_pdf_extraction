Non-dimensionalization
We express the displacements (r, z) in terms of half the length of the swimmer, l.
We consider swimmers with concentration gradients generated by the colloids on a scale c∗/a.
Hence we express the flux J̃ of reactant (product) particles in units of c∗D/a, the concentration field c̃ in units of c∗, (where D is the diffusion coefficient of the reactant/product particles), the interaction energy Ψ̃ in the units of thermal energy kBT, (kB the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature of the solution), the flow field ṽ with U∗ = µ∗c∗/a (where µ∗ = kBTL∗²/η is the characteristic phoretic mobility coefficient, η is the viscosity of the fluid and L∗ is the short-range interaction lengthscale of the reactant (product) molecules with the swimmer surface).
We scale the pressure field p̃ with ηU∗/l.
We note that the problem has three length-scales; the swimmer characteristic length 2l, its cross-sectional radius a and the range L∗ of the interaction between the molecules and swimmer surface.
Consequently, we have three asymptotic near-field regions and in addition the scale on which the ends of the rod are rounded.
We therefore define the dimensionless parameters, ε = a/l, the slenderness ratio and λ = L∗/l, the interaction layer thickness to the swimmer largest lengthscale, with 0 < λ ≪ ε ≪ 1.
In addition, we define dimensionless fields J = J̃a/c∗D, c = c̃/c∗, v = ṽ/U∗, p = p̃l/ηU∗, ψ = ψ̃/kBT, and the dimensionless catalytic flux α = α̃a/c∗D on the swimmer surface.

where λ = L∗/l is the ratio of the interaction length-scale to half the length of the swimmer, ε = a/l is the swimmer slenderness ratio and ψ(r − εS(z), z) is the short-range interaction potential between reactant (product) molecules and surface.
