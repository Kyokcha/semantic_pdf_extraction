Fp^A = ∑_i |ni| (m²_i(φ₀) − m²_i(φn)) ∫ d³p / (2π)³ 2Ei,p(φ₀) f_eq i,p(φ₀).  
Here ni is the number of degrees of freedom for species i, mi(φ) are the field-dependent masses (including the thermal masses for the bosons), Ei,p(φ) = √(p² + m²_i(φ)), and f_eq i,p are the equilibrium distribution functions.  
Since the wall’s motion is assumed to be ultra-relativistic, the passage of the wall changes the masses sharply but leaves the distribution functions as they were in the symmetric phase to leading order in 1/γ (where γ = 1/√(1 − v²)) [95].  
As pointed out in Ref. [92], the above expression is equivalent to the free-energy density difference between the minima in the so-called mean field T ≠ 0 thermal effective potential, Ṽ_T [92, 95].  
Ṽ_T is simply given by a Taylor expansion of V₁,T around the symmetric minimum in field space, truncated at quadratic order in the field-dependent masses, i.e.  
Ṽ_T(φ, T ≠ 0) ≡ V_T(φ₀, T ≠ 0) + ∑_i (m²_i(φ) − m²_i(φ₀)) dV_T(φ₀, T ≠ 0) / dm²_i.  
With this definition, the condition that must be satisfied for the wall to run away can be re-phrased as Ṽ_T(φn, Tn) − Ṽ_T(φ₀, Tn) < V₁(φ₀, T = 0) − V₁(φn, T = 0).  
Re-arranging, and defining the full 1-loop mean field effective potential Ṽ(φ, T) ≡ V₀(φ) + V₁(φ, T = 0) + Ṽ_T(φ, T), the runaway condition becomes  
Ṽ(φ₀, Tn) − Ṽ(φn, Tn) > 0, ↔ Runaway solution exists.  
This suggests the following criterion for determining whether the wall is safe from runaway [92]:  
If tunneling to the broken minimum φn is not energetically favored in the mean field potential, the wall cannot run away.  
Thus, for all of our benchmarks, it suffices to compute both the full effective potential and the mean field potential along the tunneling direction.  
If the symmetry-breaking minimum disappears or is raised above the symmetric minimum in the mean field limit, the wall will remain sub-luminal.  
We will check against this criterion for all of the points we consider.
