Figure 1: Phase diagram of the classical Hamiltonian (4) for N = 3 colors and disorder distribution (5) with Jh = 1, Jl = 0.25, and c = 0.5.
The dots and triangles mark the numerically determined transitions between the Baxter, product, and paramagnetic phases.
The solid lines are guides to the eye only.
The dashed line marks εc = 1.281 which separates the weak and strong coupling regimes in the strong-disorder renormalization group calculations.
Where ⟨...⟩ denotes the thermodynamic (Monte Carlo) average and [...]dis is the disorder average.
In addition, we also measure the product order parameter
p = (1 / 3LLt) ∑ (α < β) |∑ (i,t) Sαi,t Sβi,t|, (8)
the corresponding product susceptibility χp, and the product Binder cumulant gp.
The phase diagram of the classical Hamiltonian (4) resulting from these simulations is shown in Fig. 1.
In the weak-coupling regime, ε < εc, we find a direct transition between the magnetically ordered Baxter phase at low temperatures and the paramagnetic high-temperature phase.
For strong coupling, ε > εc, these two phases are separated by a product phase.
In the following, we study the critical behaviors of the transitions separating these phases in detail, and we compare them to the renormalization group predictions.
Weak coupling regime
In the weak-coupling regime, ε < εc, we perform simulations for coupling strengths ε = 0, 0.3 and 0.5 employing the Wolff and Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithms as discussed above.
Because the disorder breaks the symmetry between the space and (imaginary) time directions in the Hamiltonian (4), the finite-size scaling analysis of the data to find the critical exponents becomes more complicated.
This is caused by the fact that the system sizes L and Lt in the space and time directions are expected to have different scaling behavior.
Thus, the correct aspect ratios Lt/L of the samples to be used in the simulations are not known a priori.
To overcome this problem we follow the iterative method employed in Refs. 45–48 which is based on the Binder cumulant.
As the renormalization group calculations predict infinite-randomness criticality with activated dynamical scaling, the scaling form of the Binder cumulant (which has scale dimension 0) reads
gav(r, L, Lt) = Xg(rL^(1/ν), ln(Lt/L₀t)/L^ψ). (9)
Here r = (T − Tc)/Tc denotes the distance from criticality, Xg is a scaling function, and ψ and ν refer to the tunneling and correlation length critical exponents.
L₀t is a microscopic reference scale.
For fixed L, gav has a maximum as function of Lt at position Lmax_t and value gmax_av.
The position of the maximum yields the optimal sample shape for which the system sizes L and Lt behave as the correlation lengths ξ and ξt.
At criticality Lt must thus behave as ln(Lmax_t / L₀t) ∼ L^ψ, fixing the second argument of the scaling function Xg.
Consequently, the peak value gmax_av is independent of L at criticality, and the gav vs. r curves of optimally shaped samples cross at T = Tc.
Once the optimal sample shapes are found, finite-size scaling proceeds as usual.
To test our simulation and data analysis technique, we first consider the case ε = 0 for which the quantum Ashkin-Teller model reduces to three decoupled random transverse-field Ising chains whose quantum phase transition is well understood.
We perform simulations for sizes L = 10 to 50 and Lt = 2 to 20000 and find a critical temperature Tc ≈ 1.24.
At this temperature, we confirm the activated scaling (9) of the Binder cumulant with the expected value ψ = 1/2.
We also confirm the scaling of the magnetization at Tc (for the optimally shaped samples), m ∼ L^(−β/ν) with β = 0.382 and ν = 2.
After this successful test, we now turn to the Ashkin-Teller model proper.
We perform two sets of simulations: ε = 0.5 using system sizes L = 10 to 60, Lt = 2 to 60000 and ε = 0.3 with system sizes L = 10 to 50, Lt = 2 to 40000.
In each case, we start from a guess for the optimal shapes and find an approximate value of Tc from the crossing of the gav vs. T curves for different L.
We then find the maxima of the gav vs. Lt curves at this temperature which yield improved optimal shapes.
After iterating this procedure two or three times, we obtain Tc and the optimal shapes with reasonable precision.
Figure 2 shows the resulting Binder cumulant gav for ε = 0.5 as function of Lt for different L at the approximate critical temperature of Tc = 2.08(5).
As expected at Tc, the maxima gmax_av of these curves are independent of L.
The slightly lower values at the smallest L can be attributed to corrections to scaling.
Moreover, the figure shows that the gav vs. Lt domes rapidly become broader with increasing spatial size L, indicating non-power-law scaling.
