D(B)dB = (1 / √(2πσB)) * exp[−(B − B₀)² / (2σB²)] (1)
where the two parameters, the mean barrier B₀ and the distribution width σB, are to be determined individually for each reaction.
III. THE FUSION CROSS SECTION
The energy dependence of the fusion cross section is obtained by folding the barrier distribution [9, 10] provided by Eq.(1), with the classical expression for the fusion cross section given by
σf(B) = πRB² * (1 − B/E) for B ≤ E  
= 0 for B ≥ E (2)
where RB denotes the relative distance corresponding to the position of the barrier approximately, which yields
σfus(E) = ∫₀^∞ σf(B)D(B)dB  
= ∫₀^B₀ σf(B)D(B)dB + ∫B₀^E σf(B)D(B)dB (3)  
= πRB² * (σB/E√(2π)) * [ξ√π{erf ξ + erf ξ₀} + e^(−ξ²) + e^(−ξ₀²)]
where  
ξ = (E − B₀) / (σB√2)  
ξ₀ = B₀ / (σB√2) (4)
and erf ξ is the Gaussian error integral of argument ξ.
The parameters B₀ and σB along with RB are to be determined by fitting Eq.(3) along with Eq.(4) to a given fusion excitation function.
In the derivation of formula Eq.(3), the quantum effect of sub-barrier tunneling is not accounted for explicitly.
However, the influence of the tunneling on shape of a given fusion excitation function is effectively included in the width parameter σB.
The fusion cross section formula of Eq.(3) obtained by using the diffused-barrier is a very elegant parametrization of the cross section for a process of overcoming the potential-energy barrier.
Hence, it can be successfully used for analysis and predictions of the fusion excitation functions of light, medium and moderately heavy systems, especially in the range of near-barrier energies.
The term ‘capture’ is used to refer the process of overcoming the interaction barrier in a nucleus-nucleus collision, followed by formation of a composite system.
In general, the composite system undergoes fusion only in a fraction f of the capture events.
For light and medium systems, f ≈ 1, and almost all the ‘capture’ events lead to fusion resulting fusion cross sections to be practically identical with the capture cross sections.
However, for very heavy systems, only a small fraction (f < 1) of ‘capture’ events ultimately lead to fusion while for the remaining part of the events, the system re-separates prior to equilibration and clear distinction between fusion and capture cross sections then becomes necessary.
Therefore, for very heavy systems, when overcoming the barrier does not guarantee fusion, predictions based on Eq.(3) give the capture cross section.
IV. CALCULATION AND RESULTS
The near-barrier (above barrier) fusion excitation functions of medium and heavy nucleus-nucleus systems have been analyzed using a simple diffused barrier formula (given by Eq.(1)) derived by folding the Gaussian barrier distribution with the classical expression for the fusion cross section for a fixed barrier.
The same set of target-projectile combinations have been selected for which heavy ion sub-barrier fusion has been recently [11] studied.
The values of mean barrier height B₀, width σB and the effective radius RB have been obtained using the least-square fit method.
These values are listed in Table-I and arranged in order of the increasing value of the Coulomb parameter z = Z₁Z₂ / (A₁^(1/3) + A₂^(1/3)).
Since the number of data points for ⁴⁸Ca+¹²⁴Sn is too low compared to other systems, the error bars for B₀ (111.93 ± 0.44), σB (1.28 ± 0.83) and RB (8.24 ± 0.09) are rather large.
